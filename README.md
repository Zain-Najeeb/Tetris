This is my Tetris project that I've made entirely in Java. If you would like a video explanation of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5u7ShnMbS8. The controls are: Up arrow to rotate, left and right arrow to move, down arrow to fast drop, spacebar to hard drop and shift to hold a piece.
